# how to use (OUTDATED, captchas arent that good, look into captcha API)

make sure to install all the files from the repo in order for it to work then go to config.json and set the path
where images should be saved. do not delete anything cause u need everything in the repo for the gen to work

install *requirements.txt* (make sure ur in the cd)

```
pip install requirements.txt
```
or
```
py -m pip install requirements.txt
```

safe captchas n easy to use, the file names are the captcha solutions. this is good to use in things like discord
bot verification systems.
