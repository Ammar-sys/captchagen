## captchagen

Hi, this code creates secure captchas using PILLOW (PIL) python library. In order for this to work, you will need following modules: 

- PILLOW
- random
- os

In order to install these, run following commands in cmd:

```
pip install PIL
pip install random
pip install os
```

For this to work you'll need to change paths to your own (obviously)

Do whatever you want with it, if you're going to use it credit would be aprecitiated. For any questions DM me on discord ammar#0443.
